some notes how i got it running in 2022:
- installing Miniconda works
- its an adaped version of the [MCEdit-Unified editor](https://github.com/Podshot/MCEdit-Unified)
- restrict pygame version to 1.9.4
- this [Wiki page](https://gendesignmc.wikidot.com/wiki:submission-mcedit) is more up to date
- Minecraft is only needed to generate worlds in the editor. So if you use eg. the Competition maps from last year you wont need minecraft to create and test filters.

# Welcome to the Generative Design in Minecraft Competition Repo
Here you will find information about how to build artificial intelligence for minecraft.
